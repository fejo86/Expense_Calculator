>This is a basic python program that calculate the monthly expense.

>It have five python files
 1.expense_tracker.py is the main py file of the program
 2.expense.py - where the class is declared
 3.months.py -the date and time calculations
 4.text_formatting- the text formating codes for change font colour and make text bold
 5.clear_program -  code for delete all the content in the file
-And the data will be stored in the file expese_data.csv
